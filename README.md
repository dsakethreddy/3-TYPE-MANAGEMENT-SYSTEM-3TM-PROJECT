# 3-TYPE-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-3TM-PROJECT
This a java project made by me during my graduation. This project is made by keeping PAYTM in mind as motive , I have name my project as 3 TYPE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM because it has 3 main functionalities which define or represent my project 1) Explore (As if paytm has - Recharge, Movie tickets), 2) Manage Bank account (As if paytm has it's virtual payments bank ), 3)Registration (I  have used database to provide login system). I have used JDBC library to establish connection to my project and database.

JDBC components that I have used to establish connection and run queries:-
1) Java.sql.Connection class - to establish connection;
2) Java.sql.PreparedStatement - to perform or to run a query;
3) Java.sql.ResultSet - store output acquired after running a query.
